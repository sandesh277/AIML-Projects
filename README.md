# AIML-Projects
Course projects completed during PGP -Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Great Learning


# [Project1: Statistical Learning: Project Overview](https://github.com/sandesh277/AIML-Projects/tree/main/01-AppliedStatistics)

* Covers Descriptive Statistics, Probability & Conditional Probability, Hypothesis Testing, Inferential Statistics, Probability Distributions, Types of distribution and Binomial, Poisson & Normal distribution.
* This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, bmi, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance.

# [Project2: Supervised Machine Learning: Project Overview](https://github.com/sandesh277/AIML-Projects/tree/main/02-Supervised-Learning)

* Objective: The classification goal was to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans
* Covers Multiple Variable Linear regression, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifiers, Multiple regression, K-NN classification, Support vector machines
* Identified potential loan customers for Thera Bank using classification techniques. Compared models built with Logistic Regression and KNN algorithm in order to select the best performing one
* Predicted the possibility that a customer will buy a personal loan or not 
* Exploratory data analysis using matplotlib and seaborn libraries 
* Descriptive and inferential statistics to gain valuable insights from data
* Data processing and preparation like normalization, splitting of data for model
* Trained and tested different supervised learning algorithms â€“ Logistic regression, KNN and Logistic regression to predict a potential customer buying a personal loan
* Model performance assessment using techniques like confusion matrix, classification reports etc
